  <h3>Just A Little Fella</h3>
  <p>Born December 9th, 1988, year of our lord. At an early age, an interest in music had taken hold due to my father's interest
    in music. Whilst starting on drums and realizing there was no place in the world of drummers for your old pal Sam, I
    switched to the guitar and the rest is history.</p>

  <h3>High School</h3>
  <p>As a teenager, an interest in being bands had formed as I had falsely guessed that I had come far enough along in my musical
    travels, I began to start playing with people instead of alone in my basement. It turned out to be difficult, and put
    me back in the basement for a while. After a couple more years of learning Blink 182 songs, I was back in the saddle
    and ready to party.</p>

  <h3>Adult Life</h3>
  <p>Sixteen years later, here I am sitting in a classroom learning about computers.
    <strong>But I'm still ready to party</strong>.</p>
